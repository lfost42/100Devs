# Class 34

Leon ‚Äî 08/11/2020
Hey @everyone! 

Day 01 of the bootcamp starts in 1 hour (6:30pm ET) live on Twitch: leonnoel.com/twitch

Here are the slides if you would like to follow along: https://slides.com/leonnoel/html-the-basics/live 

Also, the two starter files you‚Äôll need for the code along and lab portions are attached! 

You‚Äôll need a browser. I recommend chrome because we will use the built in dev tools later in the bootcamp and a text editor. I recommend atom.io if you are on gnu/linux, macOS, or Windows and codepen.io if you are on a chromebook.
Learn with Leon and Friends

We are running a free bootcamp for those affected by the pandemic. If you would like to explore a career in tech and learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascipt you should join us now. Also, follow the chat rules or you will be kicked.

Hey @everyone,

My apologies again today for the stream! I just upgraded my internet to EXTREME PRO+, so we shouldn't run into issues again! 

After the stream ended, I took the time to recorded the whole lecture and you can find it on youtube now: https://youtu.be/6RS2wUi0Muo 

The slides can be found here: http://slides.com/leonnoel/css-responsive-basics

I missed having you all there with me live, but wanted to make sure I got this class out asap. I respect the heck out of all the hard work you are putting into the class and for giving me your time after a long day. I don't want to disrespect that time and will work hard to get the stream going strong! 

Attached are an updated template, the materials for class, and the class solutions. Let me know if you have any questions and see you at office hours on Saturday at 12pm est!

Hey @everyone! 

üö®üö®üö® !important; PLEASE READ üö®üö®üö® 

I accepted the Twitch Affiliate Agreement over the weekend for two reasons. One it increases the likelihood that our streams will get quality options (the ability to set the resolution) and it unlocked channel points. Hopefully now, you will get the chance to enjoy the stream in the quality that works best for you and the longer you hang out, participate, and join raids the more channel points you will unlock. Channel points can be redeemed for silly things like telling me to hydrate or serious things like a resume review. The problem, however, is that you will now see a short ad as you join the stream and will have the ability to subscribe and cheer bits. PLEASE DO NOT FEEL THE NEED TO SUBSCRIBE OR CHEER. I want this to remain a 100% free community. I will never release content that you can not access for free and I will never lock options behind a subscription EVER. This includes all tutorials, classes, or any educational content I create. There are too many folx in this space for the wrong reasons and I want it to be clear that I believe access to education is a right and that it should be FREE. For now, should someone subscribe, donate, or cheer all of that money will be donated to Resilient Coders (https://resilientcoders.org/).

Ok, back to the usual üòÉ 

üî• Tonight we are going deeper with JS and learning all about functions with lots of hands on practice üî•

Hey @everyone 

 This is a hard message to send, but this past week and especially today has been super rough mental health wise for me. I don't have the energy to give our first JS lecture the love it deserves. So instead of class tonight, we'll have our "icebreaker meet your housemates event part 2" that a lot of folx have been asking for to kick off our first week of networking! Let's work out the awkwardness and practice meeting new folx together tonight! 

Our first JS lecture will be on Thursday and all work will be due then. While you are waiting for or after your house meet and greet, please make your layouts better! Also, today is #givingTuesday, so I would really appreciate if you could like and retweet this instead of checking in tonight: https://twitter.com/leonnoel/status/1333896543967952902

Hamilton will meet at 6:30pm EST here (FIRST 200 - sorry, site max): https://icebreaker.video/events/U9BmGUHBO4Q5HMDhGDEP

Hopper will meet at 7:15pm EST here: https://icebreaker.video/events/U3aXEZDAGhRw1Tjc7pIs

Turing will meet at 8:00pm EST here: https://icebreaker.video/events/ex9Wzbp5qPb3Dhr5osF2

Each Meet & Greet will be 45mins. Mic & Camera is required for the site to work and the site works well on phones too. 

Looking forward to spending some time with you all this evening!

Hey @everyone 

Thanks for digging deep and pushing through some tough topics tonight! Local Storage and dealing with complex APIs is NOT EASY!

Remember, NO CLASS THURSDAY. Instead of class, I'm going to ask that you fill out a survey, work on crafting your story,  and buff your resume before Friday's class.  I'll share links / resources on Thursday. 

Also, now that we have partner and can risk being more experimental with our extra classes, without the risk of losing quality settings. What would you like to see? More review, more projects, more push, more office hours...? Please think through what you would like to see for #100Devs and be ready to share in the survey on Thursday! Thank you!

Hey @everyone 

BREATH! That was a lot of info to get through in 3 hours. You should be proud of seeing it through and giving your brain a workout! 

We'll worry about homework on Thursday. I want you to review, play, and break the code we went over tonight. Get lost in it, come with questions, and ready to review on Thursday. 

We only have one more topic to go: Async / Await / Promises and then we are ready to shift gears and move into the backend! So excited for you to see how unscary the backend can be, and for you to be able to build full stack apps! 

I know this stuff is tough! Hang in there, and we'll make it to the end. Much Love!
