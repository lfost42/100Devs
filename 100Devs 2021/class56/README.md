Hey @everyone THE TEA SPILLITH!  You REALLY don't want to miss this one! 

Come learn how Eden balanced being a single mom to an amazing son with autism with learning to code and ultimately landing an engineering role at a hot new startup building cyber security tools for the US government without a degree!

Then for part two, come hear about @dayhaysoos's amazing journey into tech. From the slogs of agency life, to becoming a beacon in the open source community, building a huge following online, and having their work sponsored by Stripe!

They want to SPILL ALL THE TEA! Salaries, offers, the good, and the bad! 

:letmein:   We are meeting in our classroom in 60 minutes: https://live.remo.co/e/100devs-classroom

Hey @everyone 

Grandma is doing better, but I can't hold class tonight. We'll be back at it on Tuesday to finish strong!

And then leading a charge to get some Hitlist work done together in our classroom: https://live.remo.co/e/100devs-classroom

Be sure to check out the stream and then PLEASE use this time to get ahead on your hitlist. Networking GETS JOBS. Please don't get got...

Hey @everyone 

My apologies, but I need one more day and then we are coming back STRONG! :doit: 

I can't begin to even describe how hype Thursday's class will be... 

We are diving deep into Big O for class and laying the roadmap to finishing, but SO MANY OTHER THINGS WILL BE POPPING OFF.  New Sponsors, First AGENCY PROJECT, and a 100Devs Tournament with $5,000 on the line :mindblown: 

Come find out how to finish #100devs strong, lock down a job, and win a lot of cash! Don't MISS THURSDAY's CLASS!

---

Also, thank you for all the love and support! It really meant a lot to hear from so many of you. I'm coming back Super Energized to help you all cross the finish line. I've got a lot planned, so hold on, stay strong, and we're going to get those jobs! 

For those, doing Mega Summer, see you at standup. Everyone else, see you Thursday to continue becoming lean mean interviewing machines and having some fun too! 

You all are missed!

Much Love (seriously),
Leon

Hey @everyone,

If you are reading this (yes you), I need to use all my Leon Points and ask a big favor! If you are currently job hunting or want to start THE HUNT SOON, please join us in our classroom tonight (https://live.remo.co/e/100devs-classroom). In the past month, I’ve done 60+ 30min 1on1s but I haven’t been able to meet with all of you embarking on THE HUNT! 

I want a chance to talk with everyone in small groups to gauge where folx are at and how I can best help them. 

Here is the slight change to the game plan: 

I’ve opened ⭐mega-summer-daily  to everyone who clicked in 💪🏽join-100devs . This is where folx, a part of MEGA SUMMER, get their daily code challenge. Tonight we are working in groups to run these questions back and MAKE SURE OUR BASE INTERVIEW SKILLS ARE ON POINT. While you are working through your questions, I will be stopping by each table to talk with you all. 

🗓️ SCHEDULE:

🔥 :pikahello: 🔥 Tomorrow (Friday): Our VERY OWN @Nicolas L aka Daddy_Anki SPILLS THE TEA on how they landed their NEW JOB! 🔥 :pikahello: 🔥 

Saturday (1pm ET): Code Jam - Come Build Build A Portfolio Project With A Team  :elmosfire: SPICY EDITION  :elmosfire: 

Sunday (1pm ET): Office Hours - Come ask all your questions and help me test my new setup! 

🚨  Tues (Aug 3): Intro To Data structures & Big O Notation 🚨 

🚨  Thurs (Aug 5): Key Algorithms For THE HUNT 🚨 

AUG 26th HOLD A SPOT ON YOUR CALENDAR FOR A NIGHT THAT WILL KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF! 

Tea Spilling, Jams, and Office Hours Continue and ONLY 4 MORE ADDITIONAL CLASSES (Algos & React)!?!

🥳 🥳 🥳 Also, HUGE CONGRATS to @jasminbuddy🌻  for locking down TWO OFFERS including one from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise! 
"This Saturday is my 26th birthday and I am so happy that I finally in the tech industry and can say goodbye to warehouse jobs I had ☺️🥲🥲"


See you in 55 minutes and DAMN do I have some JUICY BEANS TO SPILL about our #100Devs $5,000 Tournament Of Champions!
