Leon — 05/06/2021
Hey @everyone 

:pikahello:    Class-44 of #100Devs starts in 55 minutes (6:30pm ET) live on Twitch: https://leonnoel.com/twitch

We are continuing our Backend Super Review and then jumping to Remo to finish our team projects.

So far you have all booked $64,000+ in new clients  , helped 23 grassroots orgs  , & contributed to 20+ projects!

✅ Instead of checking-in please update your Linkedin to include the new 100Devs Company

Here are the slides if you would like to follow along: https://slides.com/leonnoel/backend-crash-course-100devs/live (remove /live for a non auto-advancing  copy)

👉🏾 Submit your 10 Codewars Repo here: https://forms.gle/cJiie5s85jmxLKet8

🗓 Homework Due Tuesday (May 11th):
Please,
Finish: TEAM PROJECT
Finish: HITLIST
Please research the following methods:
map
reduce
filter
forEach
sort
slice
pop
shift
push
unshift
includes
indexOf
every

Give a short description of what the method does, how it works, it's time complexity (if appropriate), and give three examples of it in action!

Questions to practice:

One:
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order. Example:
[1, 2, 3, 4] => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24

Two:
You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed 'age' of 0. Return a new array with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].

Three:
Sum all the numbers of the array except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!).
Example:
[ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 ] => 16
[ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 ] => 6

5 codewars tagged as arrays (minimum)

Add what you learn to an interview deck on Anki!

🚨 NO FRIDAY CLASS & NO OFFICE HOURS SUNDAY - FINISH YOUR PROJECTS & HITLIST 🚨

Hey @everyone

My apologies, in the commotion of Tuesday, I forgot that Today is Eid (a religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide that marks the end of the month-long dawn-to-sunset fasting of Ramadan). As such, we will not hold class tonight! 


The following will be due tomorrow before class and we'll hold our normal Friday session at 6:30pm ET on Remo. Hoping to take a look at a few of your team projects live and share some important info about the interview process and MEGA MONTH JUNE! 

🚨 Please submit your work here: https://forms.gle/Y8T57oJNWLSEQjQc8
(Looking for your Team Project, Hitlist, Methods work, and Codewars)


:pikahello:  Simba is doing great and NEXT WEEK WE START REACT!!! Super pumped!


🗓 Homework Due Tuesday (May 18th):
Review your methods and the questions assigned last week. 👉🏾 ANKI ALERT 🚨 
Start React:
Read - https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70 (old, weird, just get through it)
Watch  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8 (2 hours - just get through it)
Do - https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react (2-3 hours - just get through it)
Also, if able, please get some movement in as the next month or two will require a lot of hunkered down coding time! I've been enjoying this mobility routine:  https://youtu.be/SsT_go-oCcQ


🔥 Let's Build An App From Scratchish - BACKEND REVIEW SUNDAY 1:00pm ET 🔥
