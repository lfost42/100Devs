Hey @everyone 

Recently, I have been really struggling with my mental health. I need to take the day and won't be able to stream class tonight. If you need a break, I highly encourage you to take one this evening too. 

If not, please put some effort into practicing the interview methods we learned last class tonight. Record yourself and figure out your quirks! Please finish: The Ultimate Guide to JavaScript Algorithms Courses (https://scotch.io/courses/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-algorithms) if you have not yet. Continue to put time into your 100hours project and premium apps due next week! 

Also, Microsoft has wonderfully agreed to push our sponsored stream to Tuesday!  We'll be building three portfolio pieces that include facial detection, object detection, and the ability to recognize brands which will help you stand out during the interview process! We'll be giving away swag, Azure credit, and TWO LAPTOPS! Bring the hype and tell a friend! 

I'll see some of you for 1on1s tomorrow and Saturday, but for everyone else I'll see you on Tuesday and please take care of yourself! You have put in so much work and are so close. Let's finish strong starting next week! 

Much love,
Leon
