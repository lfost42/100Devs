# Class 49


Leon â€” 06/15/2021
Hey @everyone tonight is an important class NOT TO BE MISSED if you want a JOB! 

We are going to start off by talking with two recent RC Alumni whose total offers well surpassed HALF A MILLION DOLLARS! :mindblown: 

They are spilling all the tea, answering your questions about the job hunt, and giving you their perspective on what 20+ companies are ACTUALLY looking for when you apply. This will be raw, not recored, and obviously needs to happen in our classroom!

:pikahello:  Class-49 of #100Devs starts in 50 minutes (6:30pm ET) live in our classroom: https://live.remo.co/e/100devs-classroom

After we'll have two IMPORTANT sessions, that will help you get a job! We'll be reviewing application materials live and walking through how to survive a technical interview! 

:excited:  Also, we'll be raffling off something amazing! Please if you ever want to get a job as a software engineer DO NOT MISS THIS CLASS! 

âœ… Instead of checking-in, please follow these brave souls who agreed to share all the nitty gritty details:
