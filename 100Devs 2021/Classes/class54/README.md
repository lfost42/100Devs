# Class 54


Leon — 07/08/2021
Hey @everyone 

Tonight we are going to do things a little differently! Based on what I've seen during 1on1s, I want to cover some MEGA METHODS with you. We will be holding class in our classroom: https://live.remo.co/e/100devs-classroom and rotating between lecture and working in small groups to solve challenges. We are going to scramble tables after each mini-lecture, so come meet a bunch of your fellow #100Devs! 

:pikahello:  Class-54 of #100Devs starts in 25 minutes (6:30pm ET) live in our classroom: https://live.remo.co/e/100devs-classroom
