Hey @everyone 

Unfortunately, I have to cancel class tonight. Machi had a dental surgery scheduled for today and wound up having to do more work than expected. Just talked to the doctor and she is doing well but they will need to keep her until during class time. We'll pick back up with React on Thursday and I'm REALLY excited for that class. I think folx will walk away with a good understanding of the basics! 

🚨  For now, please work on completing your 100 Hours Projects & 10 Premium Apps which are DUE NEXT TUESDAY! :cattyping:

Hey @everyone 

Really sorry, but I need to push tonight's class again. We'll finish up React next week and then move into Data Structures and Algorithms!

Tomorrow, we are going to have a really important session on starting the interview process and battling the thoughts of not be ready. Sneak peak, you are ready, but let me explain why tomorrow in our classroom at 6:30pm ET. 

🚨   For now, please work on completing your 100 Hours Projects DUE NEXT TUESDAY! & 10 Premium Apps which we are going to push two weeks.
